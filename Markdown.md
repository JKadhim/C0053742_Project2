issues with index being out of range in contact deletion method. the problem was with the number of lines changing as I
deleted one. fixed by only deleting the top line multiple times for the contact, so I stayed within range.

I had issues with storing the data in the text file in a correct format, I was trying to store an array on one line.
to solve this I changed my approach and grouped my data in lines of 4. In further practicals I will attempt to learn
the pickle method to make information storage more concise.

had issues with the variable naming method. I eventually changed it to snake case so its readable
